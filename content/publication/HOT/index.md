abstract: Operons are a hallmark of bacterial genomes, where they allow concerted expression of functionally 
  related genes as single polycistronic transcripts. They are rare in eukaryotes, where each gene usually 
  drives expression of its own independent messenger RNAs. Here, we report the horizontal operon transfer of 
  a siderophore biosynthesis pathway from relatives of Escherichia coli into a group of budding yeast taxa. 
  We further show that the co-linearly arranged secondary metabolism genes are expressed, exhibit eukaryotic 
  transcriptional features, and enable the sequestration and uptake of iron. After transfer, several genetic 
  changes occurred during subsequent evolution, including the gain of new transcription start sites that were
  sometimes within protein-coding sequences, acquisition of polyadenylation sites, structural rearrangements,
  and integration of eukaryotic genes into the cluster. We conclude that the genes were likely acquired as a 
  unit, modified for eukaryotic gene expression, and maintained by selection to adapt to the highly 
  competitive, iron-limited environment.

summary: Some yeast species harbor enterobactin biosynthesis genes unseen in other fungi. 
  An ancient horizontal operon transfer occurred from bacteria to a group of yeasts.
  The operon underwent genetic changes after transfer to a eukaryotic genome.
  The genes are expressed monocistronically and result in enterobactin production.
