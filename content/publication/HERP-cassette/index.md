abstract: Current genome editing techniques available for Saccharomyces yeast species rely on 
  auxotrophic markers, limiting their use in wild and industrial strains and species. Taking 
  advantage of the ancient loss of thymidine kinase in the fungal kingdom, we have developed 
  the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase gene as a selectable and counterselectable marker 
  that forms the core of novel genome engineering tools called the Haploid Engineering and 
  Replacement Protocol (HERP) cassettes. Here we show that these cassettes allow a researcher 
  to rapidly generate heterogeneous populations of cells with thousands of independent 
  chromosomal allele replacements using mixed PCR products. We further show that the high 
  efficiency of this approach enables the simultaneous replacement of both alleles in diploid 
  cells. Using these new techniques, many of the most powerful yeast genetic manipulation 
  strategies are now available in wild, industrial, and other prototrophic strains from across 
  the diverse Saccharomyces genus.
