abstract: Budding yeasts (subphylum Saccharomycotina) are found in every biome and are as genetically diverse
  as plants or animals. To understand budding yeast evolution, we analyzed the genomes of 332 yeast species,
  including 220 newly sequenced ones, which represent nearly one-third of all known budding yeast diversity.
  Here, we establish a robust genus-level phylogeny comprising 12 major clades, infer the timescale of
  diversification from the Devonian period to the present, quantify horizontal gene transfer (HGT), and
  reconstruct the evolution of 45 metabolic traits and the metabolic toolkit of the budding yeast common
  ancestor (BYCA). We infer that BYCA was metabolically complex and chronicle the tempo and mode of genomic
  and phenotypic evolution across the subphylum, which is characterized by very low HGT levels and widespread
  losses of traits and the genes that control them. More generally, our results argue that reductive
  evolution is a major mode of evolutionary diversification.
